  <title>The Eventing Module for Apache Axis2/C</title>
</head>

<body xml:lang="en">
<h1>Welcome to Apache Savan/C</h1>

<p> Savan/C is a C implementation of WS-Eventing specification published by IBM, Microsoft, BEA and TIBCO. Savan/C is built on top of Axis2/C. Therefore by using Savan/C you can add ws eventing capability to the web services hosted using Axis2/C.
Savan was designed as a general Publisher/Subscriber tool. The arcitecture was designed to abstract the general Pub/Sub features so that people could support more than one Pub/Sub mechanism within the same infrastructure. Initially support is provided for WS-Eventing. It is planned to implement some support for Atom as well.</p>
