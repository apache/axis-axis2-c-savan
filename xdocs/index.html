  <title>The Eventing Module for Apache Axis2/C</title>
</head>

<body xml:lang="en">
<h1>Welcome to Apache Savan/C</h1>

<p>Savan/C is a C implementation of WS-Eventing specification published by
IBM, Microsoft, BEA and TIBCO. Savan/C is built on top of Axis2/C. Therefore
by using Savan/C you can add ws eventing capability to the web services
hosted using Axis2/C. Savan was designed as a general Publisher/Subscriber
tool. The arcitecture was designed to abstract the general Pub/Sub features
so that people could support more than one Pub/Sub mechanism within the same
infrastructure. Initially support is provided for WS-Eventing. It is planned
to implement some support for Atom as well.</p>
