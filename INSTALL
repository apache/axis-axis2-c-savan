1. Installing and Running on Linux

This can be done using binary or source distributions.

1.1. Installing Savan/C Source Release on Linux

This version of Savan/C depends on Axis2/C 1.1. Download from

http://ws.apache.org/axis2/c/download.cgi 

and install.
    Download Savan source distribution
    Extract the source distribution and go to extracted directory
    Run configure with AXIS2 include path.
    ./configure --prefix=<AXIS2C_HOME> --enable-static=no --with-axis2=<AXIS2C_HOME>/include/axis2-1.1 --enable-filtering=no/yes
    make
    make install
    
This will install the Savan/C as a module in Axis2/C in <AXIS2C_HOME>/modules folder. The module
folder contains the Savan/C libraries and the module.xml file. In the module.xml file give a valid path 
for database storage. The database name should be savan_db.
<parameter name="savan_db" locked="false">/axis2c/deploy/savan_db</parameter>
It will also install libsavan_client.so savan client
library in <AXIS2C_HOME>/lib folder. This client library is needed for savan clients to be linked with.
To test the installation you can run the subscriber sample by running 
<AXIS2C_HOME/bin/samples/savan/subscriber


1.2. Installing Savan/C Binary Release on Linux

Savan/C binary distribution for Linux has the following folder structure. 
    Savan
        |
        + - modules/savan (savan module library and module.xml file)
        + - docs
        |
        + - samples
               |
               + - source files of samples in folders
        + - services (Contain Subscription Manager service and sample data source services)
        |
        + - include ( header files)
        + - bin
        + - bin/samples/savan ( sample executables)
        + - lib
    To deploy Savan/C in Axis2/C running environment do the following
    1. Copy the modules/savan into <AXIS2C_HOME>/modules folder.
    2  In the module.xml file give a valid path for database storage. savan_db should be the database name.
        <parameter name="savan_db" locked="false">/axis2c/deploy/savan_db</parameter>
    3. Copy the libsavan_client.so into <AXIS2C_HOME>/lib folder. This client library is needed for savan clients 
        to be linked with.
    4. Copy the samples/server/axis2.xml into <AXIS2C_HOME> or do neccessary changes as described in README 
        document to existing axis2.xml in repository.
    5. Copy the services/subscription service into <AXIS2C_HOME>/serivces folder.
    6. If you need deploy server samples copy services/pubisher and services/listener service into 
        <AXIS2C_HOME>/serivces folder.
    7. Now you can run the client subscriber sample from bin/samples/savan

2. Installing and Running on Microsoft Windows

This too can be done using binary or source distributions.

http://ws.apache.org/savan/c/download.cgi


2.1. Installing Savan/C Source Release on Windows
    You need to have unziped Axis2/C 1.1.0 release binary to some folder.
    On your cmd.exe cd to <savan src>\build\win32 
      Edit configure.in file with your binary locations. 
    
    To set necessary environment variables on command line run vcvars32.bat file. 
    Run nmake dist command on command line. This will build the Savan/C binary and samples to a directory savan in <savan src>\build\savan. 


2. 2. Installing Savan/C Binary Release on Windows

Savan/C binary distribution will have following directory structure. 
    Savan
        |
        + - Savan (savan module dll and module.xml file)
        |
        + - samples
               |
               + - bin 
               |
               + - source files of samples in folders
        |
        + - include ( header files)

    1 Copy Savan directory ( containing savan dll and module.xml ) to <AXIS2C_HOME>\modules directory.
    2  In the module.xml file give a valid path for database storage. savan_db should be the database name.
        <parameter name="savan_db" locked="false">/axis2c/deploy/savan_db</parameter>
    3. Copy the savan_client.dll into <AXIS2C_HOME>/lib folder. This client library is needed for savan clients 
        to be linked with.
    4. Copy the samples/server/axis2.xml into <AXIS2C_HOME> or do neccessary changes as described in README 
        document to existing axis2.xml in repository.
    5. Copy the services/subscription service into <AXIS2C_HOME>/serivces folder.
    6. If you need deploy server samples copy services/pubisher and services/listener service into 
        <AXIS2C_HOME>/serivces folder.
    7. Now you can run the client subscriber sample from bin/samples/savan
    

Notes:
       Savan/C has a persistent storage mechanism for storing subscriber information and data source information. 
       This is implemented using Sqlite embedded database
       If you use Axis2/C Apache2 module instead of simple_axis2_server make 
       sure that Apache2 user have full access to the sqlite database file savan_db. 

       Savan/C module is installed into <AXIS2C_HOME>/modules/savanc directory. The installed module contain
       libsavan.so, module.xml. The sample clients are installed into <AXIS2C_HOME>/bin/samples/savan
       directory. Sample services are installed into <AXIS2C_HOME>/services directory.
